It's my first try to TDD a quicksort.

I've tried to refactor to the quicksort algorithm in the first early test cases.

(I've recognized two approaches: 

 1 - test the efficiency and rewrite the code in the end
 2 - refactor to the solution intentionally while it's been coded

I've tried the second one here)
